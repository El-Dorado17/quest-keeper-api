This is a programming challenge
If you're expected to write the full code, it'd be mentioned in the code area. All inputs 
are from STDIN (Standard Input) and output to STDOUT (Standard Output). If you're using Java, 
use the classname as 'Solution'.  This may be useful - https://www.interviewstreet.com/recruit/challenges/faq/view

To understand more about the environment, time limits, etc. you can read the FAQ here

You will be scored based on all the test cases.  
Some test cases are hidden but test whether your code applies to all variants of the problem.  

To do as well as possible, please write your solutions to be applicable for all problems, not
 a specific test case.  
You do NOT need to solve every question in this test. You only have to solve one question to move 
on to the next stage in the process. We still encourage you to attempt all of the questions.
